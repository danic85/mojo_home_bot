At the sound of me, women may laugh
Or sometimes weep.
<em>Music</em></li>
<li>What has a forest but no trees.
cities but no people and
rivers but no water??
<em>Map</em></li>
<li>I have rivers without water, Forests without trees, Mountains without rocks
Towns without houses.
What am I?
<em>A Map</em></li>
<li>When I’m metal or wood, I help you get home.
When I’m flesh and I’m blood, In the darkness I roam.
<em>A bat</em></li>
<li>Runs smoother than any rhyme, loves to fall but cannot climb!
<em>Water</em></li>
<li>If you were running a race, and you passed the person in 2nd place, what place would you be in now?
<em>2nd</em></li>
<li>I am a box that holds keys without locks, yet they can unlock your soul.
What am I?
<em>Piano</em></li>
<li>When you call out my name, I am no longer with you. What am I?
<em>Silence</em></li>
<li>Forward I’m heavy
Backwards I’m not
<em>ton</em></li>
<li>A horrid monster hides from the day, With many legs and many eyes.
With silver chains it catches prey, And eats it all before it dies.
Yet in every cottage does it stay, And every castle ‘neath the sky.
A s<em>pider</em></li>
<li>What can you put in a barrel to make it lighter?
A h<em>ole</em></li>
<li>What do you use to hoe a row, slay a foe, and wring with woe?
<em>Hands</em></li>
<li>As destructive as life, As healing as death;
An institutioner of strife, Just as prone to bless.
It is all that is good, Yet with an evil trend;
As it was the beginning of things, It can also be the end.
<em>Fire</em></li>
<li>Runs over fields and woods all day
Under the bed at night sits not alone, With long tongue hanging out, A-waiting for a bone.
<em>A shoe</em></li>
<li>Whoever makes it, tells it not.
Whoever takes it, knows it not.
And whoever knows it wants it not.
<em>Counterfeit money</em></li>
<li>My head bobs lazily in the sun.
You think I’m cute, For my face is yellow, My hair is white, and my body is green.
What am I?
<em>Daisy</em></li>
<li>At night they come without being fetched, And by day they are lost without being stolen.
<em>Stars</em></li>
<li>There is not wind enough to twirl
That one red leaf, nearest of its clan, Which dances as often as dance it can.
<em>The sun</em></li>
<li>When is a door not a door?
<em>When it is ajar</em></li>
<li>My tines be long, My tines be short
My tines end ere
My first report.
What am I?
<em>Lightning</em></li>
<li>From house to house I go, sometimes narrow, sometimes wide. And whether there’s rain or snow I always stay outside. What am I?
<em>A Path</em></li>
<li>I went to the woods and got it, when i got it didn’t want it, looked for it, couldn’t find it so I took it home.
What is it?
<em>Splinter</em></li>
<li>As light as a feather, but you can’t hold it for ten minutes.
<em>Breath</em></li>
<li>My first is not bent around.
My second means “lift her up”
or “cut her to the ground.”
<em>Straight Razor</em></li>
<li>Hickory-Dickory-Dock!
The mouse ran up the clock.
The clock struck one
and down did come.
Hickory-Dickory-Dock!
What am I?
<em>A guillotine</em></li>
<li>I am just two and two. I am hot. I am cold.
I’m the parent of numbers that cannot be told.
I’m a gift beyond measure, a matter of course, And I’m yielded with pleasure- then taken by force.
<em>Kiss</em></li>
<li>I protect your money from robbers and thieves
Three numbers to tell me is all that you’ll need
If your memory fails you I’m useless indeed
<em>Combination lock</em></li>
<li>Something wholly unreal, yet seems real to I
Think my friend, tell me where does it lie?
<em>In the mind</em></li>
<li>I give you a group of three.
One is sitting down, and never will get up.
The second eats as much as is given him, yet is always hungry.
The third goes away and never returns.
Stove, fire, and smoke</li>
<li>My face is always changing, but is always the same.
<em>Moon</em></li>
<li>Alive without breath, Cold as death, Never thirsty, always drinking, All in mail and never clinking.
<em>Fish</em></li>
<li>Armless, legless, I crawl around when I’m young.
Then the time of changing sleep will come.
I will awake like a newborn, flying beast, ’till then on the remains of the dead I feast.
<em>Maggot</em></li>
<li>If I fly to the moon in a ship an on the way i meet five other ships each with five crew members who each have five pets. How many in all are flying to the moon?
<em>One</em></li>
<li>I saw a creature: his stomach stuck out behind him, enormously swollen. A stalwart servant
waited upon him. What filled up his stomach
had travelled from far, and flew through his eye
He does not always die in giving life
to others, but new strength revives
in the pit of his stomach; he breathes again.
<em>Bellows</em></li>
<li>What does the job of an assassin and treachery of a thug?
<em>Time</em></li>
<li>It is said among my people that some things are improved by death.
Tell me, what stinks while living, but in death, smells good?
<em>Pig</em></li>
<li>This darksome burn, horseback brown, His rollock highroad roaring down, In coop and in comb the fleece of his foam
Flutes and low to the body falls home.
<em>River</em></li>
<li>What goes in the water red, and comes out black?
<em>Iron</em></li>
<li>A precious stone, as clear as diamond.
Seek it out whilst the sun’s near the horizon.
Though you can walk on water with its power, Try to keep it, and it’ll vanish ere an hour.
<em>Ice</em></li>
<li>With no wings, I fly. With no eyes, I see. With no arms, I climb.
More frightening than any beast, stronger than any foe. I am cunning, ruthless, and tall; in the end, I rule all.
<em>The imagination</em></li>
<li>Take me and scratch my head.
What once was red, Is black instead.
What am I?
<em>A Match</em></li>
<li>It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills, And empty holes it fills.
It comes first and follows after, Ends life, kills laughter.
<em>Dark</em></li>
<li>Half-way up the hill, I see thee at last
Lying beneath me with thy sounds and sights —
A city in the twilight, dim and vast, With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights.
<em> The Past</em></li>
<li>I’m pleasing to the eye
A tool for many absent of mind
A tapestry of fickle lies
Blind to even the most pensive spies
I’m often the breeder of fervent lust
But I am by far one you shouldn’t trust
<em> Appearance</em></li>
<li>An eye in a blue face
Saw an eye in a green face.
‘That eye is like to this eye’
Said the first eye, ‘But in low place
Not in high place.’
<em><em> </em>Sun shining on daisies which are growing in a field</em></li>
<li>All about, but cannot be seen, Can be captured, cannot be held
No throat, but can be heard.
<em> Sound</em></li>
<li>What goes through the door without pinching itself?
What sits on the stove without burning itself?
What sits on the table and is not ashamed?
<em> The sun</em></li>
<li>A red cap on my head, a stone in my throat, if you tell me the answer, I’ll give you a Groat.
What am I?
<em> A cherry</em></li>
<li>What gets wetter and wetter as it dries?
<em> Towel</em></li>
<li>I have four legs but never walk
I may be covered in flowers but have no soil
I hold food three times a day but never eat a meal
<em> Table</em></li>
<li>What measures out time, Until in time
All is smashed to it?
<em> Sand</em></li>
<li>Ripped from my mother’s womb, Beaten and burned, I become a blood-thirsty slayer
What am I?
<em> Iron ore</em></li>
<li>Iron roof, glass walls
Burns and burns
And never falls.
What am I?
<em> A Lantern</em></li>
<li>I weaken all men for hours each day.
I show you strange visions while you are away.
I take you by night, by day take you back, None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.
What am I?
<em> Sleep</em></li>
<li>First you see me in the grass dressed in yellow gay;
next I am in dainty white, then I fly away. What am I?
<em> A Dandelion</em></li>
<li>The more of these you take, the more appear behind you
<em> Steps</em></li>
<li>Inside the green house there was a white house
Inside the white house there was a red house.
Inside the red house there were lots of babies.
<em><em> </em>Watermelon</em></li>
<li>If you break me, I’ll not stop working.
If you can touch me, my work is done.
If you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after.
What am I?
<em> The heart</em></li>
<li>Creatures of power, creatures of grace, Creatures of beauty, creatures of strength.
As for their lives, they set everything’s pace, For all things must come to live under their emerald embrace. . .
Either in their life, or in their death.
What am I?
<em> Tree</em></li>
<li>I have the same name as a porcelain face, yet I carry great loads from place to place.
<em><em> </em>Dolly</em></li>
<li>It has a long neck, A name of a bird, Feeds on cargo of ships, It’s not alive.
<em> Crane</em></li>
<li>I cut through evil
like a double edged sword, And chaos flees at my approach.
Balance I single-handedly upraise, Through battles fought with heart and mind, Instead of with my gaze.
What am I?
<em> Justice</em></li>
<li>Always invisible, yet never out of sight. What are they?
<em><em> </em>The letters I &amp; S</em></li>
<li>You are trapped in a room made of dry cement, with four walls, a ceiling, floor, no windows nor doors, holes are scarce, and all you have is a box of matches.
How do you get out of the room?
<em> Three strikes, and you’re out</em></li>
<li>Placed above it makes greater things small.
Placed beside it makes small things greater.
In matters that counts it always comes first.
Where others increase it keeps all things the same.
What is it?
<em> 1</em></li>
<li>I’m by nature solitary, scarred by spear
and wounded by sword, weary of battle.
I frequently see the face of war, and fight
hateful enemies; yet I hold no hope
of help being brought to me in the battle, before I’m eventually done to death.
In the stronghold of the city sharp-edged swords, skilfully forged in the flame by smiths, bite deeply into me. I can but await
a more fearsome encounter; it is not for me
to discover in the city any of those doctors
who heal grievous wounds with roots and herbs.
The scars from sword wounds gape wider and wider;
death blows are dealt to me by day and by night.
<em> Shield</em></li>
<li>What is put on a table, cut, but never eaten?
<em> Cards</em></li>
<li>As I was going to St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.
Each wife had seven sacks, Each sack had seven cats, Each cat had seven kits;
Kits, cats, sacks and wives –
How many were going to St Ives?
<em> One</em></li>
<li>How can a woman living in New Jersey, legally marry 3 men, without ever getting a divorce, be widowed, or becoming legally separated?
<em><em> </em>She’s a Justice of the Peace</em></li>
<li>Within, I clean all that is bad and is old.
I make juice that’s the colour of gold.
Should I die, a filter machine would you need assembled to replace me
… and beans I resemble.
<em><em> </em>Kidney</em></li>
<li>What travels alone but is never alone, has a name but doesn't exist
<em> A shadow</em></li>
<li>I turn around once, What is out will not get in.
I turn around again, What is in will not get out.
<em> Iceberg</em></li>
<li>What runs around a city
but never moves?
<em> City Wall</em></li>
<li>An arm points north, east, south, then west.
Ever in circles, never pausing to rest.
It passes its brother twenty three times, As the sun passes by and the moon starts to climb.
<em><em> </em>Clock</em></li>
<li>It comes only before, It comes only after, Rises only in darkness, But rises only in light.
It is always the same, But is yet always different.
What am I?
<em> Moon</em></li>
<li>Name-called And favourite to eat, Has only two toes on print of feet, Colours many, Almost any Country child would have seen one
<em> Chicken</em></li>
<li>My thunder comes before my lightning.
My lightning comes before my rain.
And my rain dries all the ground it touches.
What am I?
<em> A volcano</em></li>
<li>There are 3 words in the English language. These three words all end in -gry. One is hungry, the other is angry. The third is one that you use every day, if you were paying attention I already gave you the answer.
<em><em> </em>The English Language</em></li>
<li>I am born in fear, raised in truth, and I come to my own in deed.
When comes a time that I'm called forth, I come to serve the cause of need.
<em><em> </em>Courage</em></li>

<li>What makes noise, stops noise, and does not like noise?
<em> Your wife</em></li>
<li>What work is it that the faster you work, the longer it is before you’re done, and the slower you work, the sooner you’re finished?
<em> </em><em>Roasting meat on a spit</em></li>
<li>A beggar’s brother died, but the man who died had no brother.
How could this be?
<em> The beggar was a woman</em></li>
