<li>When there is fire in me then I am still cold. When I own your true love’s face then you will not see me. To all things I give no more than I am given. In time I may have all things, and yet I can keep nothing. What am I?<br />
<em>A mirror</em></li>
<li>I am, in truth, a yellow fork<br />
From tables in the sky<br />
By inadvertent fingers dropped<br />
The awful cutlery.<br />
Of mansions never quite disclosed<br />
And never quite concealed<br />
The apparatus of the dark<br />
To ignorance revealed.<br />
<em>Lightning</em></li>
<li>What is greater than God,<br />
More evil than the Devil,<br />
The poor have it,<br />
The rich want it,<br />
but if you eat me,<br />
you’ll die?<br />
<em>Nothing</em></li>
<li>I make you weak at the worst of all times.<br />
I keep you safe, I keep you fine.<br />
I make your hands sweat, and your heart grow cold,<br />
I visit the weak, but seldom the bold.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>Fear</em></li>
<li>What has four wheels and flies?<br />
<em>Garbage truck</em></li>
<li>I dig out tiny caves, and store gold and silver in them.<br />
I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold.<br />
They are the smallest you could imagine.<br />
Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Who am I?<br />
<em>Dentist</em></li>
<li>I am the hole in the night,<br />
the ever watchful eye.<br />
I return in a cycle,<br />
to enlighten the sky.<br />
<em>The moon</em></li>
<li>With potent, flowery words speak I,<br />
Of something common, vulgar, dry;<br />
I weave webs of pedantic prose,<br />
In effort to befuddle those,<br />
Who think I wile time away,<br />
In lofty things, above all day<br />
The common kind that linger where<br />
Monadic beings live and fare;<br />
Practical I may not be,<br />
But life, it seems, is full of me!</li>
<li><em>A Riddle</em></li>
<li>A box without hinges, key or lid,<br />
Yet golden treasure inside is hid.<br />
<em>Egg</em></li>
<li>No sooner spoken than broken<br />
<em>Silence</em></li>
<li>On my way to St. Ives,<br />
I met a man with seven wives.<br />
Each wife had seven sacks,<br />
Each sack had seven cats,<br />
Each cat had seven kits.<br />
Kits, cats, sacks, wives,<br />
How many were going to St. Ives?<br />
<em>One</em></li>
<li>A big Indian and a little Indian are walking down the street.<br />
The little Indian is the son of the big Indian but the big Indian is not the father of the little Indian. How is this possible?<br />
<em>The big Indian is the Mother</em></li>
<li>I do not breathe, but I run and jump.<br />
I do not eat, but I swim and stretch.<br />
I do not drink, but I sleep and stand.<br />
I do not think, but I grow and play.<br />
I do not see, but you see me every day.<br />
<em>I am a leg</em></li>
<li>You can see nothing else<br />
When you look in my face,<br />
I will look you in the eye<br />
And I will never lie.<br />
<em>Your reflection</em></li>
<li>Blend a teapot shot so the pearlies won’t rot!<br />
<em>Toothpaste</em></li>
<li>I blind you, I give you food, I give you light, I give you death, I give you life, I am always there, I am never there. What am I?<br />
<em>The sun</em></li>
<li>Whilst I was engaged in sitting<br />
I spied the dead carrying the living<br />
<em>Ship</em></li>
<li>Tool of thief, toy of queen.<br />
Always used to be unseen.<br />
Sign of joy, sign of sorrow.<br />
Giving all likeness borrowed.<br />
<em>Mask</em></li>
<li>My first is in wield, sever bones and marrow.<br />
My second is in blade, forged in cold steel.<br />
My third is in arbalest, and also in arrows.<br />
My fourth is in power, plunged through a shield.<br />
My fifth is in honour, and also in vows<br />
My last will put an end to it all.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>Weapon</em></li>
<li>People are hired to get rid of me.<br />
I’m often hiding under your bed.<br />
In time I’ll always return you see.<br />
Bite me and you’re surely dead.<br />
<em>Dust</em></li>
<li>Always wax, yet always wane: I melt, succumbed to the flame.<br />
Lighting darkness, with fate unblest, I soon devolve to shapeless mess.<br />
<em>Candle</em></li>
<li>Large as a mountain, small as a pea,<br />
Endlessly swimming in a waterless sea.<br />
<em>Asteroids</em></li>
<li>Two words, my answer is only two words.<br />
To keep me, you must give me.<br />
<em>Your word</em></li>
<li>At the sound of me, men may dream<br />
Or stamp their feet<br />
At the sound of me, women may laugh<br />
Or sometimes weep.<br />
<em>Music</em></li>
<li>What has a forest but no trees.<br />
cities but no people and<br />
rivers but no water??<br />
<em>Map</em></li>
<li>I have rivers without water,<br />
Forests without trees,<br />
Mountains without rocks<br />
Towns without houses.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>A Map</em></li>
<li>When I’m metal or wood,<br />
I help you get home.<br />
When I’m flesh and I’m blood,<br />
In the darkness I roam.<br />
<em>A bat</em></li>
<li>Runs smoother than any rhyme, loves to fall but cannot climb!<br />
<em>Water</em></li>
<li>If you were running a race, and you passed the person in 2nd place, what place would you be in now?<br />
<em>2nd</em></li>
<li>I am a box that holds keys without locks, yet they can unlock your soul.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>Piano</em></li>
<li>When you call out my name, I am no longer with you. What am I?<br />
<em>Silence</em></li>
<li>Forward I’m heavy<br />
Backwards I’m not<br />
<em>ton</em></li>
<li>A horrid monster hides from the day,<br />
With many legs and many eyes.<br />
With silver chains it catches prey,<br />
And eats it all before it dies.<br />
Yet in every cottage does it stay,<br />
And every castle ‘neath the sky.<br />
A s<em>pider</em></li>
<li>What can you put in a barrel to make it lighter?<br />
A h<em>ole</em></li>
<li>What do you use to hoe a row, slay a foe, and wring with woe?<br />
<em>Hands</em></li>
<li>As destructive as life,<br />
As healing as death;<br />
An institutioner of strife,<br />
Just as prone to bless.<br />
It is all that is good,<br />
Yet with an evil trend;<br />
As it was the beginning of things,<br />
It can also be the end.<br />
<em>Fire</em></li>
<li>Runs over fields and woods all day<br />
Under the bed at night sits not alone,<br />
With long tongue hanging out,<br />
A-waiting for a bone.<br />
<em>A shoe</em></li>
<li>Whoever makes it, tells it not.<br />
Whoever takes it, knows it not.<br />
And whoever knows it wants it not.<br />
<em>Counterfeit money</em></li>
<li>My head bobs lazily in the sun.<br />
You think I’m cute,<br />
For my face is yellow,<br />
My hair is white,<br />
and my body is green.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>Daisy</em></li>
<li>At night they come without being fetched,<br />
And by day they are lost without being stolen.<br />
<em>Stars</em></li>
<li>There is not wind enough to twirl<br />
That one red leaf, nearest of its clan,<br />
Which dances as often as dance it can.<br />
<em>The sun</em></li>
<li>When is a door not a door?<br />
<em>When it is ajar</em></li>
<li>My tines be long,<br />
My tines be short<br />
My tines end ere<br />
My first report.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>Lightning</em></li>
<li>From house to house I go, sometimes narrow, sometimes wide. And whether there’s rain or snow I always stay outside. What am I?<br />
<em>A Path</em></li>
<li>I went to the woods and got it, when i got it didn’t want it, looked for it, couldn’t find it so I took it home.<br />
What is it?<br />
<em>Splinter</em></li>
<li>As light as a feather, but you can’t hold it for ten minutes.<br />
<em>Breath</em></li>
<li>My first is not bent around.<br />
My second means “lift her up”<br />
or “cut her to the ground.”<br />
<em>Straight Razor</em></li>
<li>Hickory-Dickory-Dock!<br />
The mouse ran up the clock.<br />
The clock struck one<br />
and down did come.<br />
Hickory-Dickory-Dock!<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>A guillotine</em></li>
<li>I am just two and two. I am hot. I am cold.<br />
I’m the parent of numbers that cannot be told.<br />
I’m a gift beyond measure, a matter of course,<br />
And I’m yielded with pleasure- then taken by force.<br />
<em>Kiss</em></li>
<li>I protect your money from robbers and thieves<br />
Three numbers to tell me is all that you’ll need<br />
If your memory fails you I’m useless indeed<br />
<em>Combination lock</em></li>
<li>Something wholly unreal, yet seems real to I<br />
Think my friend, tell me where does it lie?<br />
<em>In the mind</em></li>
<li>I give you a group of three.<br />
One is sitting down, and never will get up.<br />
The second eats as much as is given him,<br />
yet is always hungry.<br />
The third goes away and never returns.<br />
Stove, fire, and smoke</li>
<li>My face is always changing, but is always the same.<br />
<em>Moon</em></li>
<li>Alive without breath,<br />
Cold as death,<br />
Never thirsty, always drinking,<br />
All in mail and never clinking.<br />
<em>Fish</em></li>
<li>Armless, legless, I crawl around when I’m young.<br />
Then the time of changing sleep will come.<br />
I will awake like a newborn, flying beast,<br />
’till then on the remains of the dead I feast.<br />
<em>Maggot</em></li>
<li>If I fly to the moon in a ship an on the way i meet five other ships each with five crew members who each have five pets. How many in all are flying to the moon?<br />
<em>One</em></li>
<li>I saw a creature: his stomach stuck out behind him,<br />
enormously swollen. A stalwart servant<br />
waited upon him. What filled up his stomach<br />
had travelled from far, and flew through his eye<br />
He does not always die in giving life<br />
to others, but new strength revives<br />
in the pit of his stomach; he breathes again.<br />
<em>Bellows</em></li>
<li>What does the job of an assassin and treachery of a thug?<br />
<em>Time</em></li>
<li>It is said among my people that some things are improved by death.<br />
Tell me, what stinks while living, but in death, smells good?<br />
<em>Pig</em></li>
<li>This darksome burn, horseback brown,<br />
His rollock highroad roaring down,<br />
In coop and in comb the fleece of his foam<br />
Flutes and low to the body falls home.<br />
<em>River</em></li>
<li>What goes in the water red, and comes out black?<br />
<em>Iron</em></li>
<li>A precious stone, as clear as diamond.<br />
Seek it out whilst the sun’s near the horizon.<br />
Though you can walk on water with its power,<br />
Try to keep it, and it’ll vanish ere an hour.<br />
<em>Ice</em></li>
<li>With no wings, I fly. With no eyes, I see. With no arms, I climb.<br />
More frightening than any beast, stronger than any foe. I am cunning, ruthless, and tall; in the end, I rule all.<br />
<em>The imagination</em></li>
<li>Take me and scratch my head.<br />
What once was red,<br />
Is black instead.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>A Match</em></li>
<li>It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,<br />
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.<br />
It lies behind stars and under hills,<br />
And empty holes it fills.<br />
It comes first and follows after,<br />
Ends life, kills laughter.<br />
<em>Dark</em></li>
<li>Half-way up the hill, I see thee at last<br />
Lying beneath me with thy sounds and sights —<br />
A city in the twilight, dim and vast,<br />
With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights.<br />
<em>    The Past</em></li>
<li>I’m pleasing to the eye<br />
A tool for many absent of mind<br />
A tapestry of fickle lies<br />
Blind to even the most pensive spies<br />
I’m often the breeder of fervent lust<br />
But I am by far one you shouldn’t trust<br />
<em>    Appearance</em></li>
<li>An eye in a blue face<br />
Saw an eye in a green face.<br />
‘That eye is like to this eye’<br />
Said the first eye,<br />
‘But in low place<br />
Not in high place.’<br />
<em><em>    </em>Sun shining on daisies which are growing in a field</em></li>
<li>All about, but cannot be seen,<br />
Can be captured, cannot be held<br />
No throat, but can be heard.<br />
<em>    Sound</em></li>
<li>What goes through the door without pinching itself?<br />
What sits on the stove without burning itself?<br />
What sits on the table and is not ashamed?<br />
<em>    The sun</em></li>
<li>A red cap on my head,<br />
a stone in my throat,<br />
if you tell me the answer,<br />
I’ll give you a Groat.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    A cherry</em></li>
<li>What gets wetter and wetter as it dries?<br />
<em>    Towel</em></li>
<li>I have four legs but never walk<br />
I may be covered in flowers but have no soil<br />
I hold food three times a day but never eat a meal<br />
<em>    Table</em></li>
<li>What measures out time,<br />
Until in time<br />
All is smashed to it?<br />
<em>    Sand</em></li>
<li>Ripped from my mother’s womb,<br />
Beaten and burned,<br />
I become a blood-thirsty slayer<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    Iron ore</em></li>
<li>Iron roof, glass walls<br />
Burns and burns<br />
And never falls.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    A Lantern</em></li>
<li>I weaken all men for hours each day.<br />
I show you strange visions while you are away.<br />
I take you by night, by day take you back,<br />
None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    Sleep</em></li>
<li>First you see me in the grass dressed in yellow gay;<br />
next I am in dainty white, then I fly away. What am I?<br />
<em>    A Dandelion</em></li>
<li>The more of these you take, the more appear behind you<br />
<em>    Steps</em></li>
<li>Inside the green house there was a white house<br />
Inside the white house there was a red house.<br />
Inside the red house there were lots of babies.<br />
<em><em>    </em>Watermelon</em></li>
<li>If you break me, I’ll not stop working.<br />
If you can touch me, my work is done.<br />
If you lose me, you must find me with a ring soon after.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    The heart</em></li>
<li>Creatures of power, creatures of grace,<br />
Creatures of beauty, creatures of strength.<br />
As for their lives, they set everything’s pace,<br />
For all things must come to live under their emerald embrace. . .<br />
Either in their life, or in their death.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    Tree</em></li>
<li>I have the same name as a porcelain face,<br />
yet I carry great loads from place to place.<br />
<em><em>    </em>Dolly</em></li>
<li>It has a long neck,<br />
A name of a bird,<br />
Feeds on cargo of ships,<br />
It’s not alive.<br />
<em>    Crane</em></li>
<li>I cut through evil<br />
like a double edged sword,<br />
And chaos flees at my approach.<br />
Balance I single-handedly upraise,<br />
Through battles fought with heart and mind,<br />
Instead of with my gaze.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    Justice</em></li>
<li>Always invisible, yet never out of sight. What are they?<br />
<em><em>    </em>The letters I &amp; S</em></li>
<li>You are trapped in a room made of dry cement, with four walls, a ceiling, floor, no windows nor doors, holes are scarce, and all you have is a box of matches.<br />
How do you get out of the room?<br />
<em>    Three strikes, and you’re out</em></li>
<li>Placed above it makes greater things small.<br />
Placed beside it makes small things greater.<br />
In matters that counts it always comes first.<br />
Where others increase it keeps all things the same.<br />
What is it?<br />
<em>    1</em></li>
<li>I’m by nature solitary, scarred by spear<br />
and wounded by sword, weary of battle.<br />
I frequently see the face of war, and fight<br />
hateful enemies; yet I hold no hope<br />
of help being brought to me in the battle,<br />
before I’m eventually done to death.<br />
In the stronghold of the city sharp-edged swords,<br />
skilfully forged in the flame by smiths,<br />
bite deeply into me. I can but await<br />
a more fearsome encounter; it is not for me<br />
to discover in the city any of those doctors<br />
who heal grievous wounds with roots and herbs.<br />
The scars from sword wounds gape wider and wider;<br />
death blows are dealt to me by day and by night.<br />
<em>    Shield</em></li>
<li>What is put on a table, cut, but never eaten?<br />
<em>    Cards</em></li>
<li>As I was going to St Ives,<br />
I met a man with seven wives.<br />
Each wife had seven sacks,<br />
Each sack had seven cats,<br />
Each cat had seven kits;<br />

<li>How can a woman living in New Jersey, legally marry 3 men, without ever getting a divorce, be widowed, or becoming legally separated?<br />
<em><em>    </em>She’s a Justice of the Peace</em></li>
<li>Within, I clean all that is bad and is old.<br />
I make juice that’s the colour of gold.<br />
Should I die, a filter machine would you need assembled to replace me<br />
… and beans I resemble.<br />
<em><em>    </em>Kidney</em></li>
<li>What travels alone but is never alone, has a name but doesn't exist<br />
<em>    A shadow</em></li>
<li>I turn around once,<br />
What is out will not get in.<br />
I turn around again,<br />
What is in will not get out.<br />
<em>    Iceberg</em></li>
<li>What runs around a city<br />
but never moves?<br />
<em>    City Wall</em></li>
<li>An arm points north, east, south, then west.<br />
Ever in circles, never pausing to rest.<br />
It passes its brother twenty three times,<br />
As the sun passes by and the moon starts to climb.<br />
<em><em>    </em>Clock</em></li>
<li>It comes only before,<br />
It comes only after,<br />
Rises only in darkness,<br />
But rises only in light.<br />
It is always the same,<br />
But is yet always different.<br />

My lightning comes before my rain.<br />
And my rain dries all the ground it touches.<br />
What am I?<br />
<em>    A volcano</em></li>
<li>There are 3 words in the English language. These three words all end in -gry. One is hungry, the other is angry. The third is one that you use every day, if you were paying attention I already gave you the answer.<br />
<em><em>    </em>The English Language</em></li>
